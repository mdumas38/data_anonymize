# Key-Value Storage Guide for Data Anonymization

## Overview
This module handles key-value data storage. Apply anonymization to any PII stored in this system to maintain data privacy.

## Instructions
- **Anonymize Before Storage:** Ensure that all sensitive data is anonymized before being stored in key-value pairs. Use the anonymization utilities in `/packages/utils/anonymization.ts`.

- **Retrieve Anonymized Data:** When retrieving data, ensure that it remains anonymized unless a specific, secure de-anonymization process is needed.

- **Data Security:** Apply secure access controls and encryption where necessary to protect sensitive data in the key-value store.
