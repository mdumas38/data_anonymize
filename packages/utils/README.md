# Anonymization Utilities Guide

## Overview
This directory contains core anonymization functions. These utilities will be used across various parts of the application to ensure data privacy.

## Instructions
- **Core Anonymization Functions:** Implement core anonymization functions (e.g., data masking, tokenization, differential privacy) in `/packages/utils/anonymization.ts`. These functions should be reusable across the API, database, and frontend components.

- **Reusable Code:** Ensure that the anonymization logic is modular and can be easily integrated into other parts of the application.

- **Testing and Validation:** Write comprehensive tests for each anonymization function to ensure they work as expected and meet data privacy standards.

- **Documentation:** Document each function, including its purpose, input parameters, and expected output. This will make it easier to integrate these functions into other parts of the project.
