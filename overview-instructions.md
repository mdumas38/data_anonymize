# AI-Enhanced Data Anonymization Implementation Guide

## Project Overview
This project involves integrating AI-driven data anonymization into an existing project directory structure based on the V1 template. The goal is to ensure that sensitive user data is anonymized before storage and handled securely throughout the application.

## Steps to Implement:

### 1. API Integration
- **Directory:** `/apps/api`
- **Task:** Implement anonymization logic for all API routes handling sensitive data.
- **Details:** Ensure that data is anonymized before storage and de-anonymized securely when necessary.

### 2. Supabase Integration
- **Directory:** `/packages/supabase`
- **Task:** Ensure data is anonymized before being stored in the Supabase database.
- **Details:** Integrate anonymization functions and ensure compliance with data protection regulations.

### 3. Key-Value Storage Integration
- **Directory:** `/packages/kv`
- **Task:** Anonymize any sensitive data stored in key-value pairs.
- **Details:** Implement secure retrieval processes while maintaining data privacy.

### 4. Frontend Adjustments
- **Directories:** `/apps/app` and `/apps/web`
- **Task:** Develop UI components to handle and display anonymized data.
- **Details:** Ensure the frontend provides necessary interactions for users dealing with anonymized data.

### 5. Anonymization Utility Functions
- **Directory:** `/packages/utils`
- **Task:** Implement reusable anonymization functions.
- **Details:** Create core anonymization functions and ensure they are well-documented and tested.

## General Notes:
- Ensure all steps comply with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
- Conduct thorough testing after implementing each step to validate the functionality.
- Maintain clear documentation throughout the project to facilitate future updates and maintenance.
