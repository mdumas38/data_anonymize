# API Integration Guide for Data Anonymization

## Overview
This API handles sensitive user data. Integrate the AI-Enhanced Data Anonymization logic into the API routes to ensure compliance with data privacy regulations.

## Instructions
- **Anonymization Before Storage:** Implement anonymization logic for all routes that involve storing sensitive user data. Ensure that any data stored in the database is first anonymized using the functions defined in `/packages/utils/anonymization.ts`.
  
- **De-Anonymization for Analysis:** If data needs to be de-anonymized for analysis, ensure this is done securely and only when absolutely necessary.

- **Security Considerations:** Review all API routes for potential vulnerabilities related to data handling. Apply encryption and secure access controls as needed.

- **Testing:** Implement unit tests to verify that data is correctly anonymized and de-anonymized in all relevant API routes.
